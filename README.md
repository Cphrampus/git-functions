# git-functions
A, hopefully growing, collection of scripts to help me use git better/easier/more efficently/etc.

## Usage

The script, in general, takes a command, or a series of commands, with the last argument being a comma separated list
of line numbers referring to the files output from git status

e.g.
```
gido add 1-3,5,-4,12-
```
